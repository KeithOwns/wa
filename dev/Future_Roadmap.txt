=======================================================

CURRENT STATUS (Integrated Features):

   * Kernel Stack Protection: Integrated UI Automation fallback for Windows Security settings.
   * Memory Integrity: Integrated UI Automation for toggling Core Isolation settings.
3. UI Refinement
   * Taskbar Search: Configured to 'Search box' (Windows 11 mode) for better accessibility.
4. Environment Setup

   * Legacy Protocols: Disables LLMNR via Registry.
   * NetBIOS: Disables NetBIOS over TCP/IP on active adapters.
   * Secure DNS: Automated configuration for Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1).
2. Privacy & System Tweaks (Planned)

   * Performance Mode: Visual Effects "Best Performance" toggle (visual impact warned).

DEPRECATED / PENDING REVIEW:

* User Account Hiding: Risk of accidental lockout.
* High Performance Plan: Modern Windows power management is usually superior for battery life.

SCRIPT VARIANTS (Future Roadmap):
--------------------------------
* WinAutoSECURE.ps1: Maximum hardening variant with all features enabled by default.
* WinAutoCUSTOM.ps1: Community-built config based on user-selected profiles (Dev, Office, Gamer).
